# Webpage Mockups

Welcome! This project page holds some of the front end website mockups that I've created. Go on, take a look!



## [The Next Web](https://naomiflagg.github.io/tnw-mockup/)

Mockup of The Next Web's homepage, which can be viewed [here](https://thenextweb.com/). Resize your window to view the adaptive display, built using CSS flexbox, grid and media queries. Please note that the site's content changes daily, so stories and perhaps page design may have changed since the mockup was created.


## [Newsweek](https://naomiflagg.github.io/newsweek-mockup/)

Newsweeek's homepage, a site with tons of responsive content. Newsweek's homepage can be viewed [here](https://www.newsweek.com/). Please note that the site's content changes daily, so stories and page design may have changed since the mockup was created. Mockup built using Bootstrap. 


## [The Odin Project](https://naomiflagg.github.io/top-mockup/)

The Odin Project's homepage. Built using Flaggrid, my CSS 12-grid template.


## [Intuit](https://naomiflagg.github.io/intuit-mockup/)

Recreation of Intuit's sign up page, which can be found [here](https://naomiflagg.github.io/intuit-mockup/).
